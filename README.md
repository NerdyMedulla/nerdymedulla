## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ My name is Vanshit (Vraj) Thakkar

### Here is my short intro:
- I just graduated with a B.S. in Neurobiology, Physiology, and Behavior Science from the University of California, Davis.
- I am a Research Assistant at UC Davis Medical Center, Department of Neurology, under Dr. Temitayo Oyegbile-Chidi.
  - I research executive dysfunction in patients with temporal epilepsy!
- I am applying for PhD programs in Biomedical Engineering (Neuroengineering focus) and Neuroscience. ðŸ§ ðŸ¦¾
  - I am very interested in Neuroprosthetics, Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs), Machine Learning Models, and Neuromorphic Engineering!

### I'm currently working on:
- Setting up an intro website ***[NerdyMedulla.com](https://www.nerdymedulla.com)***
- Setting up a blog/vlog for projects (and maybe even a podcast ðŸ‘€)
- Designing my stack of different models and transformers to work on different tasks simultaneously (more on that coming later)
- Other hardware projects that I will post as soon as the website is up! (which might take a while, I'm trying to learn node.js in the process)
